        <p>Dear Cozy Server,</p>
        <p>Wow... it's almost been a fully year since I've fully got to know some of you. Yes, this is about to get sappy, so deal with it. For one, thank you all for having me on here. It really does mean a lot to me when yall put up with my simping and my crazy antics.</p>
        <p>Second off, thank you for just being there for me. I've vented, ranted, yelled, etc and all you guys have done is give me love and suoport. I can not thank you enough for that.</p>
        <p>Finally, I know some of you don't celebrate Christmas, so let's make this next year another great one, ok?</p>
        <p class="sig">Love,</p>
